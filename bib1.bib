  abstract = {Randomized controlled trials of interventions to improve adherence to antiretroviral medications are not always feasible. Marginal structural models (MSM) are a statistical methodology that aims to replicate the findings of randomized controlled trials using observational data. Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders, 3 MSM estimators are available to estimate the causal effect of an intervention. Two of these estimators, G-computation and inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW), can be implemented using standard software. G-computation relies on fitting a multivariable regression of adherence on the intervention and confounders. Thus, it is related to the standard multivariable regression approach to estimating causal effects. In contrast, IPTW relies on fitting a multivariable logistic regression of the intervention on confounders. This article reviews the implementation of these methods, the assumptions underlying them, and interpretation of results. Findings are illustrated with a theoretic data example in which MSM are used to estimate the effect of a behavioral intervention on adherence to antiretroviral therapy.},

  abstract = {Multilevel statistical models have become increasingly popular among public health researchers over the past decade. Yet the enthusiasm with which these models are being adopted may obscure rather than solve some problems of statistical and substantive inference. We discuss the three most common applications of multilevel models in public health: (a) cluster-randomized trials, (b) observational studies of the multilevel etiology of health and disease, and (c) assessments of health care provider performance. In each area of investigation, we describe how multilevel models are being applied, comment on the validity of the statistical and substantive inferences being drawn, and suggest ways in which the strengths of multilevel models might be more fully exploited. We conclude with a call for more careful thinking about multilevel causal inference.},

  shorttitle = {Evaluating medication effects outside of clinical trials},
  abstract = {Recent clinical trials demonstrating that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) does not prevent coronary heart disease in women have again raised doubts concerning observational studies. Although much of the explanation probably lies in what might be called the "healthy HRT user" effect, another contributing factor may be that most observational studies included many prevalent users: women taking HRT for some time before study follow-up began. This practice can cause two types of bias, both of which plausibly may have contributed to the discrepancy between observational and randomized studies. First, prevalent users are "survivors" of the early period of pharmacotherapy, which can introduce substantial bias if risk varies with time, just as in studies of operative procedures that enroll patients after they have survived surgery. This article provides several examples of medications for which the hazard function varies with time and thus would be subject to prevalent user bias. Second, covariates for drug users at study entry often are plausibly affected by the drug itself. Investigators often do not adjust for these factors on the causal pathway, which may introduce confounding. A new-user design eliminates these biases by restricting the analysis to persons under observation at the start of the current course of treatment. This article thus argues that such designs should be used more frequently in pharmacoepidemiology.},

  issn = {0002-9262},
  abstract = {Epidemiologic studies often encounter missing covariate values. While simple methods such as stratification on missing-data status, conditional-mean imputation, and complete-subject analysis are commonly employed for handling this problem, several studies have shown that these methods can be biased under reasonable circumstances. The authors review these results in the context of logistic regression and present simulation experiments showing the limitations of the methods. The method based on missing-data indicators can exhibit severe bias even when the data are missing completely at random, and regression (conditional-mean) imputation can be inordinately sensitive to model misspecification. Even complete-subject analysis can outperform these methods. More sophisticated methods, such as maximum likelihood, multiple imputation, and weighted estimating equations, have been given extensive attention in the statistics literature. While these methods are superior to simple methods, they are not commonly used in epidemiology, no doubt due to their complexity and the lack of packaged software to apply these methods. The authors contrast the results of multiple imputation to simple methods in the analysis of a case-control study of endometrial cancer, and they find a meaningful difference in results for age at menarche. In general, the authors recommend that epidemiologists avoid using the missing-indicator method and use more sophisticated methods whenever a large proportion of data are missing.},

  abstract = {This article reviews some philosophical aspects of probability and describes how probability logic can give precise meanings to the concepts of inductive support, corroboration, refutation, and related notions, as well as provide a foundation for logically sound statistical inference. Probability logic also provides a basis for recognizing prior distributions as an integral component of statistical analysis, rather than the current misleading practice of pretending that statistics applied to observational data are objective. This basis is important, because the use of realistic priors in a statistical analysis can yield more stringent tests of hypotheses and more accurate estimates than conventional procedures.},
