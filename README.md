# Advanced Epidemiologic Methods, EPID 722


**Objective**:	Upon completion of this course learners will be better able to solve problems in epidemiologic research regarding the planning, analysis, and interpretation of complex studies.

**Description**:	This course covers state-of-the-science epidemiologic methods. We concentrate on methods based on sound theoretical principles which maximize the accuracy of inferences drawn from analyses of complex randomized and nonrandomized (observational) studies. We discuss a series of topics using assigned readings and programs written in SAS and R. Students will work in groups on a course project.
